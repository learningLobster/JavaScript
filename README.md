 This repository is summary of my Javascipt mini-games, that can be used to learn the basics of Javascipt

 In this repository you will find some simple games such as:
 - Breakout
 - Frogger
 - Memory_game
 - Rock-paper-scissors
 - Whac-a-mole

 ## How to use
 To launch this game, you will only need to clone the repository on your device, and use IDE(Development Environment) which supports Javascipt.

 ## Contributors
 For now there is only myself working on this, but feel free to contribute. And we could even make a whole website for everyone to enjoy.
